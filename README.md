# Simple Projects

These were some of the basic guided projects I did which helped me understand the structure of the Deep Learning life cycle and the implementation of each structure. Doing the projects also helped me get well versed with Tensorflow and PyTorch. These were:
1. Image Segmentation using a U-net architectural framework with EfficientNet as encoder
2. Tweet Emotion Recognition using LSTM
3. Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to generate handwritten digits
